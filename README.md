# User Driven Testing

## Overview

This repository is demo code used for my blog on [User Driven Testing](https://dev.to/aleoyakas/user-driven-testing-mc6). The code is split into 4 stages: 

1. [Application with no tests](https://github.com/aleoyakas/user-driven-testing/tree/stage/1-no-tests)
1. [Adding tests with React Testing Library](https://github.com/aleoyakas/user-driven-testing/tree/stage/2-added-react-testing-library)
1. [Refactoring our code](https://github.com/aleoyakas/user-driven-testing/tree/stage/3-refactor-event)
1. [Future proofing our tests](https://github.com/aleoyakas/user-driven-testing/tree/stage/4-add-integration-tests)

If you really want to, you can view the deployed code [here](https://udt.aleoyakas.co.uk/).
